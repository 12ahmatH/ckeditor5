	<blockquote>
	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.</span></span></p>

	</blockquote>

	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">All of us - well, maybe most of us - have encountered the quote above in the past few years. It is mostly popular on Facebook and other social networks, where people share it aplenty. No wonder, as it sounds great, it sounds smart, it is neat and, well, let&rsquo;s be frank - Albert is one hell of a figure!</span></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">The truth, however, is not as neat, not as great and people who mindlessly forward the quote are not as smart. Because, in fact, Einstein has never said that. It comes from a 2004 book &ldquo;The Rhythm of Life: Living Every Day with Passion and Purpose&rdquo; by Mathew Kelly, published almost 50 years after Albert&rsquo;s death in 1955.</span></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">He was, most probably, inspired by an essay by Amos E. Dolbear of Tufts titled &ldquo;An Educational Allegory&rdquo;, describing animals educated to work on their weakest features instead of their strongest ones. So an eagle was made to run, a penguin was forced to fly and so on. There is also the 1903 &ldquo;Jungle School Boards&rdquo; fable from an Illinois newspaper in which a monkey, a kangaroo and an elephant cannot agree on the curriculum for their animal school - should little animals be taught tree-climbing, jumping or looking wise?&nbsp;</span></span></p>

	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">In the late 1940s, something that appears to be an amalgam of the two was published and later reprinted with various changes in the 1960s. The idea evolved for decades and got mixed up with a few other quotes about being a genius originating back to the 1970s. Finally, Kelly wrote in his 2004 book:</span></span></p>

	<blockquote>
	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Albert Einstein wrote, &ldquo;Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.&rdquo; The question I have for you at this point of our journey together is, &ldquo;What is your genius?&rdquo;</span></span></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Arial">Why he attributed this to Albert Einstein remains unclear. The fact is, the quote got popular. But apparently not everybody is a genius when it comes to fact-checking and sources...</span></span><br />
